# Description

This app constantly reads GPS data and upon user request, records the GPS data and upload it to a designated Firestore.

The code for GPS reading is adapted from [the example in `react-native-geilcation-service`](https://github.com/Agontuk/react-native-geolocation-service/blob/master/example/src/App.js).
